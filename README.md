# Ethical Hacking With Metasploit

## Objective

To demonstrate the identification, exploitation, and mitigation of security vulnerabilities in a controlled environment using the Metasploit Framework. The project aims to highlight key stages of the ethical hacking process, including information gathering, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and post-exploitation activities, while ensuring adherence to ethical hacking standards and legal frameworks.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of Metasploit Framework and practical application.
- Search for open ports and trying to gain access by understanding the port versions.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Nmap: Network scanning and reconnaissance to map open ports and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Metasploit: Exploitation of identified vulnerabilities and post-exploitation to assess system defenses.
- John the Ripper: Password cracking and testing to highlight weak authentication mechanisms.
- Kali Linux is a specialized, open-source penetration testing and ethical hacking operating system equipped with numerous security tools.
- Metasploitable is a vulnerable virtual machine designed for testing and practicing exploitation techniques using tools like Metasploit in a controlled environment.
